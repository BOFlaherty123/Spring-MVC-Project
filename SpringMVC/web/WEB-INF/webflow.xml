        Flow Executor
            - The flow executor drives the execution of a flow.
            - When a user enters a flow, the flow executor creates and launches an instance of the flow execution for that user
            - When the flow pauses (such as when a view is presented to the user), the flow executor also resumes the flow
              once the user has taken some action

    <!--
       Flow Registry
            - A flow registry's job is to load flow definitions and make them available to the flow executor.
            - We can configure a flow registry in the Spring configuration with the <flow:flow-registry/> element
            - We can use the following flow-location syntax:
                - flow-location-pattern
                - flow-location (path)
                - flow-location (with an id)
